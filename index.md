<h1 id="info">What's a 6502?</h1>
The [6502 processor](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) was used in a lot of gaming console during the 80's, including the NES, Apple II, Commodore 64 (who later bought the company that made the 6502!), multiple Atari machines, and tons more. It's instruction set is known as *6502 Assembly*, or just *6502*.

##Why do I want to learn it?
Why not? It's a fun language that can be ported to many different systems! It's heavily used in the [NES development](http://nesdev.com/) community, which actively *make* NES games for emulators and consoles. Something like x86 may be used more today, but there's no real reason why you wouldn't use a language that compiles into x86. Until someone create a language that compiles to 6502, we'll all be stuck here coding it.
