#Simulator

This is a 6502 simulator that can assemble, run, and debug code developed by [skilldrick](https://github.com/skilldrick).

{% include asm.html %}

Input you code into the text area and hit `Assemble` and `Run` to see it in action.

You can debug it by checking `Debug` and go through each instruction with `Step`.

If you check `Monitor`, you can see a table of memory.

`Notes` lets you view information on the display.
